  <p>This is one of those tech of the past that change our lives forever. The Game Boy is the most popular portable handheld gmaing console ever. And I chaged the course of gaming history. Kids of this 21st century might never had played with that piece of tech that changed history. Nintendo Game Boy came out in the year 1989.</p>
  <p> There were other gmaing consoles in 1980, but Game Boy crushed everyone even though there were'nt few attracting features like colorful screen and sleek design. Coz the Game Boy really played the business game with true portable gaming experience. The portable gmaing tech. even though having a colorful screen weren't attracting people coz most of its battery power is consumed by the screen users had to play by pluging into the ac socket which lost the portability feature. Game Boy was able to support 59 games. Game Boy made everyone feel like true gamers then. And Game Boy design and philosophy was truly responsible for todays tech. </p>
